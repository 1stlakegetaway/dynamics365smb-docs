# How to: Update Currency Exchange Rates
You must set up a code for each currency you use if you buy or sell in currencies other than your local currency, have receivables or payables in other currencies, or record G/L transactions in different currencies.  

**Note**: This functionality requires that your experience is set to **Suite**. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

You can use an external service to keep your currency exchange rates up to date. The Yahoo Currency Exchange Rates service is preinstalled and ready to enable.

## To set up a currency exchange rate service
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon"), enter **Currency Exchange Rate Services**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **Currency Exchange Rate Service** window, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Enabled** check box to enable the service.

## To update currency exchange rates through a service
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon"), enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Update Exchange Rates** action.

The value in the **Exchange Rate** field in the **Currencies** window is updated with the latest currency exchange rate.
